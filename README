Simple GPS Locator service for android

This will fetch your location (GPS) at certain intervals (around a minute), and
pushes it to a website (<site>/setcoords.php?lat=X&long=Y.

You can there do whatever you want with the data.

Needed for a bicycle tour to provide people at home with up-to-date information 
about our current position.

Any remarks, comments etc, mail me at jthijssen@noxlogic.nl
